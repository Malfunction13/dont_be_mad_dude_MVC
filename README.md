CLI game in PHP. "Ludo" aka "Dont be mad, dude!", is a classic boardgame where 2-4 players compete to run before the others with all 4 figures through the game board.
A player can fortify a spot by placing 2 or more figures on it. Other players can step on the same spot but cannot knock out fortified figures.
Rolling the dice and evaluating next turn eligibility is done automatically by the controller and 2 second delay is given just for comfort.
